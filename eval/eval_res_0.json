    "feedback": "Feedback: The response contains several inaccuracies compared to the reference answer. Firstly, the amount of \"Copper Ore\" harvested is 40, which is less than the 48 specified in the reference answer. Additionally, the coordinates for the \"Weaponcrafting\" workshop tile have been changed from (3, 1) to (2, 1), which is a deviation from the reference. These two errors alone indicate that the response does not meet the criteria for a higher score. While the instructions are coherent and follow a logical sequence, the discrepancies in resource amounts and coordinates significantly impact the overall accuracy. Therefore, the response can be classified as somewhat incorrect due to the errors present.",

    "feedback": "Feedback: The response contains several inaccuracies compared to the reference answer. Firstly, it omits the step of unequipping the current item in the weapon slot, which is a crucial instruction in the process. Secondly, the coordinates for moving to the monster tile are incorrect; the reference answer specifies (1, -2) while the response states (4, -2). Lastly, the response does not include the step of becoming friends with the \"Yellow Slime,\" which is a significant part of the interaction. Due to these omissions and errors, the response cannot achieve a score higher than 3. The highest score it can receive based on the errors present is 3. \n\n- Missing the instruction to unequip the current item in the weapon slot.\n- Incorrect coordinates for moving to the monster tile.\n- Omission of the step to become friends with the \"Yellow Slime.\"\n\nTarget score calculation: \n- Missing instructions: 1 point deduction.\n- Incorrect coordinates: 1 point deduction.\n- Overall, the response is somewhat incorrect due to these issues.\n\nScore: 3",
